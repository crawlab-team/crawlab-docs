# Introduction

[Crawlab AI](https://www.crawlab.cn/en/ai) is an AI-powered data extraction platform that allows users to extract data
from websites and other sources using AI technologies. Crawlab AI is built on top of a series of technologies, including
large language models (LLM) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. It also provides a set of APIs for data extraction.

# SDK

Crawlab AI provides an SDK for users to integrate Crawlab AI into their own applications. The SDK is now available in
Python. Users can install the SDK using the following command:

```bash
pip install crawlab-ai
```

Please refer to the [documentation](./sdk.md) for more information on how to use the SDK.

# Playground

Crawlab AI provides a [playground](https://ai.crawlab.io/en) for users to test the data extraction capabilities of
Crawlab AI. The playground allows users to input a URL and see the extracted data in real-time. Users can also use the
playground to test the APIs provided by Crawlab AI.
