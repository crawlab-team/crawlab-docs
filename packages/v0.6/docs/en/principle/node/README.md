# Node

A node is an instance that executes and manages crawler programs. It is the basic unit of resources in a distributed
system.

There are two types of nodes:

- [Master Node](master-node.md)
- [Worker Node](worker-node.md)

If you wonder how nodes communicate between each other, you can refer to [Node Communication](node-communication.md).
