# SeaweedFS

[SeaweedFS](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs) is an open-source distributed file system which is good at hosting
small files. As Crawlab is a distributed crawler management platform, SeaweedFS serves as the medium for synchronizing
files such as scripts and program files between nodes and instances.
