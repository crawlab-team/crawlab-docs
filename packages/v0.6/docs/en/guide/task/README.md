# Task

A task is a process triggered by a [spider](../spider/README.md) which crawls data from websites, performs specific
operations, or serves other functionalities. It is the basic unit of the execution process of spiders.

In Crawlab, you can not only run tasks through only a single click, but also be able to visually view task info such as
stats, realtime logs and crawled data. Furthermore, you can set `Priority` of tasks in order to determine their
execution sequence.
