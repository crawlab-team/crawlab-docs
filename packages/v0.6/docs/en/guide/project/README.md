# Project

A project is a group of [spiders](../spider/README.md) that are normally closely related and mostly crawl sites or data
in the same category or industry. Therefore, you can regard projects as a method of grouping spiders together so that
they could be better managed.

It is in one-to-many relationship with [spiders](../spider/README.md).

## Link Spiders

You can link a spider to a project by either,

1. selecting `Project` in the spider detail page, or
2. selecting `Project` in the create new spider dialog.

## View Spiders
