Crawlab Pro offers extensive customization options that allow you to tailor the platform's appearance to match your organization's branding requirements. These customization features help create a consistent user experience across your internal tools and make the platform feel like an integrated part of your technology ecosystem. You can modify elements such as the platform name, logo, and other visual components to align with your company's identity, making Crawlab Pro feel like a native part of your organization's toolkit rather than a third-party solution.
