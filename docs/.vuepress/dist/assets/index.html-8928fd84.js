Its design goal is to help users easily create, manage, and monitor web crawler tasks. Crawlab provides a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to configure crawler tasks, set crawling rules, monitor the crawling status, and view the crawling results.</p><p>You can check the <a href="../guide">Introduction section</a> for more information.</p><h3 id="why-can-crawlab-execute-crawlers-written-in-different-programming-languages-and-frameworks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-can-crawlab-execute-crawlers-written-in-different-programming-languages-and-frameworks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why can Crawlab execute crawlers written in different programming languages and frameworks?</h3><p>Crawlab executes crawler tasks based on Shell commands. Therefore, theoretically, any crawler that can be run using Shell commands can be executed in Crawlab if the environment allows.</p><p>The <code>Execution Command</code> and <code>Parameters</code> in the crawler are concatenated to form the actual Shell command for the crawler task. For example, if the <code>Execute Command</code> of a certain crawler is <code>python main.py</code> and the parameter is <code>spider1</code>, then the Shell command for the crawler task will be <code>python main.py spider1</code>.</p><h3 id="why-does-crawlab-always-pull-version-v0-6-0-instead-of-the-latest-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-crawlab-always-pull-version-v0-6-0-instead-of-the-latest-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does Crawlab always pull version v0.6.0 instead of the latest version?</h3>',8),p={href:"https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},w=a("h3",{id:"does-crawlab-support-scrapy",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#does-crawlab-support-scrapy","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Does Crawlab support Scrapy?")],-1),m=a("p",null,[e("Yes, Crawlab supports Scrapy, and it has a built-in pipeline that can be used.
